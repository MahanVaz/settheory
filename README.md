# settheory
Some notes I took while studying set theory by myself.  The topics cover mainly cardinals, filters, club sets, stationary sets for now. These include some exercises as well. I did not cover every exercse on Jech. Sometimes I bring exercises from other books as well as my own proofs on theorems.  The notes are handwritten.
