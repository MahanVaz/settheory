# settheory
Some notes I took while studying set theory by myself.  The topics cover mainly cardinals, filters, club sets, stationary sets for now. These include some exercises as well. I did not cover every exercse on Jech. Sometimes I bring exercises from other books as well as my own proofs on theorems.  The notes are handwritten.
2nd upload edit: I added some files on chapter II of Kunen. I also added some notes on ultrafilters as well as exercises.
